PublishPress Series allows you to collect WordPress content together into a series. This is ideal for magazines, newspapers, short-story writers, teachers, comic artists, or anyone who writes multiple posts on the same topic.

== Description ==

PublishPress Series allows you to collect WordPress content together into a series. This is ideal for magazines, newspapers, short-story writers, teachers, comic artists, or anyone who writes multiple posts on the same topic.

When you're writing a post, you can easily add a post to an existing series, or start a new series. You can also add a new post into the middle of an existing series, and the plugin will adjust the order.

It's easy to keep track of what posts have been added to a series. You can also filter the post list by series giving you a quick way to see all the posts you’ve already added to the series. 

Right out-of-the-box, the Series meta box will be automatically added to posts that are a part of a series. You can modify how this meta box appears using the template for it in the Series Options Page.

Add, delete, edit all your series on one handy page. You can also upload/select images to associate with the series. PublishPress Series makes it easy to keep track of all the series you are writing!

= PublishPress Series integrates with the WordPress taxonomy system =

Included with WordPress out of the box are two taxonomies - "categories" and "tags". Publishpress Series introduces a new taxonomy "series".  Thanks to the rich API provided to plugin authors by WordPress, Publishpress Series takes advantage of (as much as possible) the built-in WP goodness!  As an added bonus - plugin developers can expand on what Publishpress Series offers by interacting with the new series taxonomy and the built-in filters and hooks.

= PublishPress Series works out of the box =

Once you've activated the plugin, all you have to do is visit the Series Options page and then you're ready to go (you don't have to change/or add anything!).  Out of the box, Publishpress Series defaults to automatically insert into your blog all the necessary "template tags" for displaying series related information.

= Complete options page for easy customization =

Nearly everything you might want to customize with Publishpress Series can be done on the Series > Options page:

* Control placement of series related info (Series Meta, Series Table of Contents, Series Postlist boxes, Series Navigation Strip, etc.)
* Customize the HTML output or series related info by using the %token% system with a token legend right on the page.
* Control what the path of your "series table of contents" link will be.
* Control how posts in a series will be displayed on series archive pages.  The default is by date in descending order (newest to oldest) - but you can order it by part too.
* Set the icon width for images associated with series for different pages.

= Many template tags for theme authors and WordPress coders =

If you like going into your theme files, you'll love the "template tags" that PublishPress Series makes available for you! All the template tags you'll ever need are found in the `series-template-tags.php` file in your Publishpress Series plugin directory.  Each tag is also fully documented inline so you can have a better idea what it does!

You can also edit the default .css file for orgSeries OR point to your custom .css in `styles.css` for your theme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What does PublishPress Series do?**

It makes it easier for you to write a series of posts on your blog/website and have them automatically linked together. One of the best ways to build an audience on your blog/website is to write short posts about the same subject over a period of time rather than one long post.  There are numerous SEO benefits to this as well.  PublishPress Series takes the hassle out of managing the serial posts and you can just focus on writing.  Another way of saying this is, PublishPress Series takes the work out of organizing series so that you write more and your readers can EASILY follow along.

**Can I customize the archive page for series?**

You sure can! Create a file called `taxonomy-series.php` and copy the code from your themes `archive.php` file and use that as the basis for building out how the series archive page looks.  You'll also want to take a look at all the template tags you can use for series in the `orgSeries-template-tags.php` file.

**Can I customize the archive page for a single series??**

Yes. Create a file named `taxonomy-series-{series-slug}.php` file and replace `{series-slug}` with the slug of your series and you'll be good to go!

**Can I create a page that lists all the series available?**

Yes, you can In the `organize-series` folder you'll see a file called `seriestoc.php`.  It's what gets loaded when you go to your series toc url (defaults at \series-toc\ but you can change this on the series options page).  Chances are though it doesn't look great with your theme (the file included just gives you an idea of what you can put in the file). What you want to do is copy this file to your theme folder and then modify it to match your theme structure (see your themes archive page for an example).  You don't need to put any of the WordPress loop code in this file.
